# MUI Server
MUI Server is a gRPC service that acts as a wrapper around  [Manticore](https://github.com/trailofbits/manticore), which will serve as the future of the [Manticore User Interface (MUI)](https://github.com/trailofbits/ManticoreUI) project. MUI Server is designed to allow developers to create Manticore UI Plugins for different disassemblers easily, and to allow for Manticore itself to be done in the cloud/remotely.

# Usage
The MUI-Core server can be run via `python3 mui_server.py`. For most applications of MUI, in which a Python interpreter available or the required dependencies are not available, users can run the stand-alone `muicore_server` binary.

Currently, MUI-Core communicates only on `localhost:50010`. 

Your MUI Plugin will require the relevant gRPC client code. You can find out how to generate gRPC client code in your desired language from [the gRPC website](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/).

You may refer to the [Protobuf Specification](muicore/MUICore.proto) for information about the RPC services provided and the message types.
